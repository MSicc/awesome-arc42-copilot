## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to ensure contributors have the right to submit their work. This is a simple, lightweight process.

### What is DCO?

By signing off your commits, you certify that:

```
(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have 
    the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in 
    the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of 
    my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license 
    and I have the right under that license to submit that work with 
    modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under 
    the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under 
    a different license), as indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person 
    who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are 
    public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal 
    information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained 
    indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project 
    or the open source license(s) involved.
```

### How to Sign Off

Simply add the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This automatically adds a `Signed-off-by` line:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

**Important:** Use your real name (no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions, please).

### Forgot to Sign?

If you forget to sign a commit, you can amend it:

```bash
git commit --amend --signoff
```

For multiple commits, you may need to rebase and sign each:

```bash
git rebase --signoff HEAD~3  # for last 3 commits
```
